# Intro to Coding: COVID-19 Edition

## Goals for today

**Disclaimer:** Today is a day of questions and setup! I hope to do more of these soon!

We have a schedule of topics but please, please, please speak up and ask for help!

If you have a question, you or your parent can type in the Hangout chat and I'll call on you for your question! This way we don't all talk at once!

## Technology Requirements

I will be using Visual Studio Code for these lessons! If you'd like to have the same environment, you can download it here:

https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

Along with an editor, we'll be needing the "language runtime" as well. We're going to be using Node.js which can be found here:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Otherwise, I will be posting the code on https://repl.it before/after each lesson that I will continue to keep up to date! The repl.it website enables you to run Node.js code in your browser without any downloads. Sadly the site still requires a sign-up in order to edit/run code.

## How to Follow Along

Option 1 (Visual Studio Code):

I'll be opening up my editor to read/write editor access so you can code along with me! In order to do this, you'll need a GitHub account. You can sign-up for one here:

https://github.com/join

**Disclaimer:** Please ask your parents for permission first!

Option 2:

Follow along with my video presentation and you can download and try to run the code later! Again, repl.it website makes it pretty easy to experiment but don't worry too much about getting code running at the beginning!

## Instructions to Run Code

Open the file `index.js` and copy/paste code from files in the "level" folders!

Click "run" at the top when you're `index.js` file is ready and watch the output on the right!
